# Taxi-Demand-Prediction
The unbalanced relationship between passenger demand and the number of running taxis induces a decrease in the profits made by companies and passenger satisfaction.
Therefore, our goal is to build an automated model selection for short term taxi demand forecasting.
# Code Description
The code was developed under the Python software, In the repository, you find four notebooks codes,(three for the base-line modes namely the Time-Varying Poisson (TVP) model,  The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, and LSTM Network for Regression model/ the fourth called Model selection which is built with three methods.
